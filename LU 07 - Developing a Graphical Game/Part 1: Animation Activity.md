# üéÆ **Activity: Animate the Game Button**

### **Objective:**

Implement animations in an Android app using both XML resources and Kotlin code to enhance user interaction.

---

### **üß† Task Description:**

Create a simple Android app with a **"Play" button** that performs animations when clicked. You‚Äôll apply **two types of animations**:

* One defined in an **XML file**
* One implemented **programmatically** in Kotlin

---

### **üìã Step-by-Step Instructions:**

#### **1. Project Setup**

* Create a new Android project with an Empty Activity.
* Name your screen *AnimateGameButtonActivity*.
* Place a button labeled ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù in the center of the screen using XML layout.

---

#### **2. Define an XML Animation**

* Create an animation XML file under the `res/anim/` directory.
* This animation should perform a **fade in and out effect** when applied to the button.

---

#### **3. Add a Programmatic Animation**

* In your activity file, write Kotlin code that animates the button when it's clicked.
* Use animations such as:

  * **Scaling** (grow/shrink effect)
  * **Rotation** (spin effect)
  * **Translation** (movement across the screen)

---

#### **4. Combine Animations**

* Trigger both the XML and programmatic animations when the user taps the Play button.

---

### **‚úÖ Deliverables:**

By the end of this activity, you should:

* Have a working button that performs multiple animations.
* Submit a screenshot or screen recording of the app running.
* Provide a short paragraph explaining:

  * What animations were used
  * How you implemented them (XML vs code)

---

### **üéØ Learning Goals:**

* Understand how animations work in Android development.
* Practice applying animations to UI elements using both XML and code.
* Improve app interactivity and visual appeal.
