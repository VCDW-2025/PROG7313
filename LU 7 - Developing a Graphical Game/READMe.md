## **Learning Unit 7: Developing a Graphical Game**

This section guides you through building a **2D Android game from scratch** using Kotlin and the Android graphics APIs. The game focuses on drawing bitmaps, handling user input, detecting collisions, and applying basic animations.

### ðŸ§© Key Concepts & Steps

#### 1. **Custom Drawing Using Canvas**

* Instead of using XML layouts, you create a custom class (e.g., `BirdieGameView`) that **extends `View`**.
* You override the `onDraw()` method to draw game elements like backgrounds and characters directly on the canvas.

#### 2. **Bitmaps**

* Bitmaps are used to draw characters (e.g., birds, Pugicorns) and UI elements like lives and background.
* `BitmapFactory.decodeResource()` is used to load image assets from `res/drawable`.

#### 3. **Touch Events**

* You override `onTouchEvent()` to respond to taps.
* Each tap makes the bird flap and move upward, controlled by a `birdSpeed` variable.

#### 4. **Game Loop with Timer or Executor**

* `Executor` is used to run `invalidate()` every 30ms, which causes continuous redrawing for animation.
* This creates the illusion of movement and interactivity.

#### 5. **Animating Game Elements**

* Characters move across the screen by updating X/Y coordinates each time `onDraw()` is called.
* Random Y positions and speed variation simulate natural motion.

#### 6. **Collisions**

* You create a `collisionCheck(x, y)` function to detect if the bird hits another object (e.g., RainbowCuppicake).
* When collisions occur, lives decrease and visual feedback (ghost icons, Toasts) is triggered.

#### 7. **Lives and Game Over**

* Life icons are shown and updated.
* When all lives are lost, "GAME OVER" is drawn on the screen, and animation stops.

#### 8. **Leveling Up**

* Youâ€™re encouraged to create multiple levels (e.g., add a taco worth 50 points in Level 2).
* At 100 points, the game transitions to a new level with different logic and appearance.

### âœ… **1. Explain the purpose of defining XML resource files**

* **Separation of concerns**: XML files allow you to separate UI design from app logic.
* **Maintainability**: UI changes donâ€™t require altering Kotlin/Java code.
* **Reusability**: Define styles, strings, colors, and layouts once and reuse them.
* **Types of XML files**:

  * `layout` (e.g., `activity_game.xml`) â€“ defines screen structure.
  * `drawable` â€“ shapes, gradients, and images.
  * `values` â€“ for storing constants (`strings.xml`, `colors.xml`, `styles.xml`).

### âœ… **2. Apply animations to controls in an app**

* **Types of animations**:

  * **Property Animation** (`ObjectAnimator`, `AnimatorSet`) â€“ animates view properties like `alpha`, `translationX`.
  * **Tween Animation** â€“ scale, rotate, move, or fade a view.
  * **Frame Animation** â€“ display a series of images (like a flipbook).
* **Usage**: Improves user experience, adds fun to game UI.
* **Tools**: Use `animator/` XML directory or animate programmatically.

### âœ… **3. Explain the use of touch events**

* **Touch events** detect interaction with the screen.
* **Handled using**: `onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event)` or `setOnTouchListener`.
* **Common touch event actions**:

  * `ACTION_DOWN` â€“ user touches screen.
  * `ACTION_MOVE` â€“ user drags finger.
  * `ACTION_UP` â€“ user lifts finger.
* **Game use**: Detect taps, swipes, or dragging objects.

### âœ… **4. Explain how to draw on a canvas**

* **Canvas**: A surface where you draw 2D graphics (lines, shapes, text, images).
* **Used inside a `View` subclass**:

  * Override `onDraw(Canvas canvas)` to customize drawing.
  * Use `Paint` objects to style (color, stroke, text size).
* **Example**: Drawing game characters, scores, or custom backgrounds.

---

### âœ… **5. Use a Timer object in Android**

* **Purpose**: Create timed events, e.g., game loops, countdowns.
* **Options**:

  * `Handler.postDelayed()` â€“ run code after delay.
  * `CountDownTimer` â€“ for countdown logic.
  * `Timer` and `TimerTask` â€“ schedule repeated actions.
* **Example**: Move an object every 100ms to simulate motion.
