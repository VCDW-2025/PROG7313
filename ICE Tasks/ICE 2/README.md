# ðŸ”§ How to Implement This in Your Android Project

## âœ… 1. Project Setup

Create a new project or activity called SplitTipActivity.

Enable ViewBinding in your build.gradle (Module):


buildFeatures {

    viewBinding true
    
}

## âœ… 2. Layout File: activity_split_tip.xml

### Make sure it contains:

EditText for:

Bill amount edtBillAmt

Tip percent edtTipPercent

Number of people edtNumPeople

TextView with ID txtEnterAmounts to prompt user to enter individual amounts.

LinearLayout with ID dynamicContainer to hold dynamically created EditTexts.

Button with ID btnCalcTip to calculate the tip.

LinearLayout with ID resultsContainer to show tip results.

## âœ… 3. Understanding Key Logic 


### ðŸ§© 1. Set Up Input Watching for Number of People

- Add a listener to detect changes in the "number of people" input field.
- When the user types a valid number, generate input fields dynamically for each personâ€™s bill contribution.
- If the input is invalid or empty, hide the input area and clear any previously generated fields.

---

### ðŸ§© 2. Dynamically Generate Input Fields

- For each person, create a new input field.
- Style each input to match the appâ€™s theme.
- Display these inputs in a vertical layout container.
- Store references to each field in a list so you can access their values later.

---

### ðŸ§© 3. Handle Tip Calculation on Button Click

- When the calculate button is clicked, retrieve values from the bill amount and tip percentage fields.
- Check that all required values are entered and valid numbers.
- Show an error message if anything is missing or invalid.

---

### ðŸ§© 4. Sum the Individual Amounts

- Loop through all dynamically generated input fields and add up the values.
- Compare the total to the main bill amount.
- If they do not match (allowing a small margin for rounding error), show an error message and stop the calculation.

---

### ðŸ§© 5. Calculate and Display Tips per Person

- For each person, calculate their individual tip based on their entered amount and the overall tip percentage.
- Create a result view (like a text label) for each person to show their tip.
- Display all these result views below the calculate button.

---

### ðŸ§© 6. Reset Views When Needed

- Clear all dynamic input fields and result views when the number of people changes.
- Hide the calculate button and results container to keep the UI clean and responsive.
