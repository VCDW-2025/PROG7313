1. **Screen Sketch & Naming**  
   - On paper or in a design tool, draw two clean rectangles labeled **Add Donut** and **Donut List**.  
   - Decide on concise names for your fragments (e.g. `AddDonutFragment`, `DonutListFragment`) so everything stays consistent.

2. **Generate Blank Fragments**  
   - In Android Studio’s **Project** pane, right‑click your package → **New → Fragment → Fragment (Blank)**.  
   - Name it exactly `AddDonutFragment`. Repeat for `DonutListFragment`.  
   - In each fragment’s layout XML, drop in a simple TextView (“Add Donut Screen” / “Donut List Screen”) to verify you’ve got the right file.

3. **Create the Navigation Graph**  
   - In **res/navigation**, create a new Navigation resource file (e.g. `nav_graph.xml`).  
   - Open it in the Navigation Editor: drag both fragments onto the canvas.  
   - In the properties panel, mark **DonutListFragment** as the **Start Destination**.

4. **Host Your Fragments**  
   - Open **activity_main.xml** (or your single‑Activity layout).  
   - Replace any placeholder container (FrameLayout) with a **NavHostFragment** from the palette.  
   - In its attributes, set **navGraph** to your newly created `nav_graph.xml`.

5. **Add the BottomNavigationView**  
   - Still in **activity_main.xml**, below (or alongside) the NavHostFragment, drag in a **BottomNavigationView**.  
   - Give it an **ID** (e.g. `bottomNav`).  
   - Ensure its layout constraints or parent layout allow it to sit at the bottom of the screen.

6. **Build the Menu Resource**  
   - Under **res/menu**, create a new menu resource file (e.g. `bottom_nav_menu.xml`).  
   - Define two `<item>` entries:  
     - One with ID `nav_add_donut`, title “Add Donut” and a gallery or “+” icon.  
     - One with ID `nav_donut_list`, title “Donut List” and a list or donut icon.  
   - Use Android Studio’s built‑in **Vector Asset** tool to pick Material icons—this guarantees crisp, scalable graphics.

7. **Link Menu to Your Nav View**  
   - In the BottomNavigationView’s XML attributes, point **app:menu** to your `bottom_nav_menu.xml`.  
   - Now the bar will render both icons and labels—no further code needed to draw it.

8. **Wire Navigation Logic**  
   - In your Activity’s initialization (onCreate), obtain the NavController tied to your NavHostFragment.  
   - Use the Navigation‑Component helper to bind your BottomNavigationView to that NavController.  
   - This single binding instructs the nav component to swap fragments when an item is tapped and to highlight the selected icon.

9. **Top‑Level Destinations & Back‑Stack**  
   - In your Navigation Graph properties, ensure both “Add Donut” and “Donut List” are marked as top‑level.  
   - This makes the system back button exit the app from either screen rather than popping intermediate fragments.  
   - Confirm that no unintended back‑stack entries accumulate as you switch tabs.

10. **Next Steps**  
    - With your nav bar solid, every fragment you now open will slot neatly into place.  
    - Future work—Add Donut form logic, Room integration, RecyclerView—lives entirely inside those fragments, leaving your navigation layer untouched.  

Good luck guiding your users across the galaxy of screens—your nav bar is now mission‑ready! 🚀
