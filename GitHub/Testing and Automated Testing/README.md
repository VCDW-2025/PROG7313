## âœ… **Overview**
Youâ€™ll be doing two things:
1. **Set up local tests** for your new Android project.
2. **Create a GitHub Actions workflow** that:
   - Runs these tests on every push or pull request.
   - Builds your app to check for errors.

---

## âœ… **PART 1: Write a Simple Test (optional but I recommend it)**

### ðŸ”¹ In Android Studio:
1. **Create a new Android project** (if you haven't already).
   - Open Android Studio and select **New Project**.
   - Choose an empty activity and proceed with the default settings.

2. Right-click the `java` folder of your app module.
   - Go to:  
     **New â†’ Java/Kotlin Class â†’ JUnit Test**
   
3. Name the class (e.g., `OrderTest`), and add a basic test for a simple class in your app. Here's an example test for an `Order` class:

```kotlin
import org.junit.Test
import org.junit.Assert.*

class OrderTest {
    @Test
    fun testOrderCreation() {
        val order = Order(1, "Test", "Latte")
        assertEquals("Latte", order.item)
    }
}
```

This test checks that an `Order` object is created correctly.

## âœ… **PART 2: Create GitHub Actions Workflow**

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Open Android Studio and go to **VCS â†’ Git â†’ Share Project on GitHub**.
3. Follow the prompts to push your project to GitHub.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Add a GitHub Actions Workflow

1. In your GitHub repo, go to:
   ```
   .github/workflows/
   ```

2. Create a file named:
   ```
   android.yml
   ```

3. Paste the following standard Android CI configuration in the `android.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Android CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up JDK 11
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        distribution: 'temurin'
        java-version: 11

    - name: Setup Android SDK
      uses: android-actions/setup-android@v2

    - name: Build project
      run: ./gradlew build

    - name: Run unit tests
      run: ./gradlew test
```

---

## âœ… **What This Workflow Does**
- **Triggers** every time you push to `main` or open a pull request.
- **Checks out your code**
- **Sets up Java and Android SDK** on a GitHub-hosted machine.
- **Builds your app** to catch compile errors.
- **Runs your tests** to catch logic issues.

---

## âœ… **View Results on GitHub**

Once you push:
1. Go to your GitHub repo.
2. Click the **"Actions" tab**.
3. Youâ€™ll see a workflow run triggered.
4. Expand the steps to view logs, errors, or test results.

---

## ðŸ§  **Why This Matters**
- Confirms your code works on other machines, not just yours (like your marker's).
- Catches errors early when collaborating.
- Encourages test-driven development.
- Impresses industry professionals â€” many expect CI/CD workflows like this.
